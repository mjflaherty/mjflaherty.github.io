          Hello! My name is Meghan Flaherty and I am a Freshman computer science major at the University of Rhode Island. I am new to programming as I only started 
        in my senior year of high school. I have always loved working with computers and technology, and was very intrigued by how it all worked and functioned. 
        I am excited to be taking this course because it is teaching me all about the ins and outs of the web.</p>
